# CLI Commands

## Local Build & Run

- use `dora build` for getting `git` sources and building nodes
- use `dora run` to run a dataflow locally
  - this does not run any build commands, so you might want to run `dora build` before

## Distributed Build & Run

Dataflows can be run across multiple machines.

### Setup
To set up a distributed Dora network, you need a machine that is reachable by all machines that you want to use. On this machine, spawn the `dora coordinator`, which is the central point of contact for all machines and the CLI. Then spawn a `dora daemon` instance on all machines that should run parts of the dataflow.

### Distributed Build, Run, and Stop
Building a distributed dataflow uses the same `dora build` command as a local build. The command will inspect the given dataflow specification file and look for `_unstable_deploy` keys in it. If it finds any, it will do a distributed build instead of a local build. A distributed build works by instructing the coordinator to send build commands to all connected daemons. This way, each node is built directly on the machine where it will run later.

To run a distributed dataflow, use the `dora start` command. By default this will _attach_ to the started dataflow. This means that the dataflow logs are printed to the terminal and that the dataflow is stopped on `ctrl-c`. You can also use the `--detach` flag to let the dataflow run in background.

If you want to stop a dataflow, you can use the `dora stop` command.

#### Dismantle a Dora Network

The `dora destroy` command instructs the coordinator to stop all running dataflows, then tells all connected daemons to exit, and finally exits itself. So it provides a way of stopping everything Dora-related.

#### Inspect

You can use the following commands to request information about distributed dataflows from the coordinator:

- use `list` to get a list of all running dataflow instances
- use `logs` to retrieve the log output of an active or finished dataflow run

### Helper Commands

- the `dora new` command helps with creating new nodes and dataflows
- the `dora graph` command visualizes a given dataflow as a graph
- the `dora self` command allows updating and uninstalling dora
- the `dora help` command prints help text
